# Next.js 15 App Router Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar rendering issue encountered in Next.js 15's App Router.  A seemingly simple component fails to render correctly, possibly due to an interaction between the new router and the component lifecycle.

## Bug Description

A basic Next.js application using the App Router fails to display the expected content. The component renders, but the content is not displayed as expected.  This is likely due to an edge case or unexpected behavior in the App Router's rendering process. The problem might be related to the way the new router handles initial renders and component hydration.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the application; you'll see that the component renders but the content is not displayed.

## Solution

The solution may involve identifying and addressing inconsistencies in the component's lifecycle or the way it interacts with the App Router.  Potential fixes could involve adjusting component rendering logic, verifying the application's hydration process, or ensuring correct usage of App Router features.
